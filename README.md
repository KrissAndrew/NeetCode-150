# Introduction 
I am working my way through the NeetCode 150 in order to improve my understanding of data structures and algorithms.
I have set up an Azure Dev Ops pipeline that runs unit tests that I write for each problem.
Each problem has an accociated pdf document, outlining the problem solution/s.

## What am I doing?
I am working my way through the [NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/)
- What is the NeetCode 150?
  - The NeetCode 150 is a curated collection of 150 programming challenges, covering a wide range or programmatic approaches, taken from the site [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com/).
	
## Why am I doing this?
- A programmers job is about more than being familiar with any one programming language.
- A good programmer, can identify common programmatic approaches to varied problems, to process them in the most efficient manner.
- By working my way through this list, I am consistently working on different problems and learning the best approaches to handle them.
	
## How am I doing this?
- I am completing each problem to the best of my ability, writing test cases and producing a document outlining each solution.
- I have set up a both a GitHub and Azure Repos repository to track my progress using cloud technologies.
  - GitHub is a web-based platform that uses git, a version control system, to allow developers to store manage and share code (You are on it right now).
    - I commit my progress here to add to my portfolio, which is easy to share with employers showing my commitment to self-improvement in this area.
  - Azure Repos allow to practice integration with additional cloud based technologies.
    - By setting up my own Azure DevOps Project and connecting it to the repository, I can set up a continuous testing style environment for my solutions.
    - By writing my own test cases for each problem, I better understand, and I can trigger the tests via pushes to the repository, turning this into a cloud based test project.
